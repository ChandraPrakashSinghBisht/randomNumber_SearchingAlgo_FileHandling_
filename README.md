Task 1: Random number generation - Create a random number generator to create a list of unique integers (each number must appear only once).     It must be able to generate at least 300 integers (no repeated numbers)      Task 2: Searching Implementation - Implement linear search, interpolation search and binary search to search an integer from a list of integers from task 1.      Task 3: Testing - Create a main function which is able to call the number generator and all algorithms. Apply the testing procedure:     Searching     By using the function from Task 1, generate 100 unique integers. Output the list in a 100data.txt or 100data.csv file.      Get the last integer in the list as k.      Read the integers from the file in an array or linked list. Apply the algorithms in Task 2 to find k from the list.
